  Modern  CPUs are impressive feats of engineering effort.  Consistently offering performance improvements every generation, but how?
  This module explores security vulnerabilities that can lurk hidden, below the assembly, in CPU architecture itself!

  Note: Meltdown challenges must be performed inside the VM!
challenges:
- id: babyarch-parseonepage
  name: Baby Spectre 1
  description: Get started with a binary that side-channels itself!
  transfer:
    dojo: software-exploitation
    module: speculative-execution
    challenge: babyarch-parseonepage
- id: babyarch-parsemultipage
  name: Baby Spectre 2
  description: A binary that side-channels itself, now using multiple pages.
  transfer:
    dojo: software-exploitation
    module: speculative-execution
    challenge: babyarch-parsemultipage

- id: level7-1
  name: Prefetch Peek
  description: Locate the flag in memory using shellcode after all references to it have been DESTROYED, you will only have access to the "exit" system call. You will need a creative way of locating the flag's address in your process!
