  Our world is built on a foundation of sand.
  You have seen the insecurities with individual programs.
  Consider that these programs, in turn, are pressed together into complex systems.
  Humanity tries its best, but the parts of systems do not fit perfectly, and gaps of insecurity abound within the seams.
  Hackers know the art of sneaking through these gaps, and now, you have reached the point of your journey where you shall develop this art as well.
  Push through, and join us on the other side.

- id: sandboxing
  name: Sandboxing
  description: |
    Computer security sandboxing refers to a technique used to isolate potentially malicious code or untrusted programs, ensuring they run in a confined environment where they cannot cause harm to the broader system. By creating a 'sandbox' or restricted space for these programs to operate in, any malicious actions are confined to this isolated area, preventing potential damage to the host system or access to sensitive data.  This module explores sandboxing techniques as well as how hackers can escape a misconfigured sandbox.

    Note, levels 14+ of the sandboxing challenges must be ran inside a virtual machine.  This virtual machine can be launched using the `vm connect` command while at a terminal.

      Some tips and tricks for the challenge problems!

      - Be very careful to understand the timeline of what the challenge does. A file opened BEFORE `chroot()` is very different from a file opened AFTER `chroot()`. The sequence of actions makes a big difference.
      - There aren't any restrictions on shellcode (other than syscalls), so we highly recommend making sure your shellcode exits cleanly. That will make it easier to debug.
      - You can determine the value of constants such as `AT_FDCWD` by writing a quick C program that includes the relevant header files and does `printf("%d\n", AT_FDCWD);`.
      - `chroot()` will fail if you're not running as root. `strace` causes the SUID bit to be ignored, so you must use `sudo strace` to properly trace these challenges. Of course, this will only be possible in practice mode.
      - There is a known issue with strace that, in certain configurations, it will improperly resolve the syscall number of 32-bit syscalls in amd64. Using a newer Linux VM sometimes helps. If you're using `int 0x80` to trigger system calls, the 32-bit ones ARE being used; strace is just lying to you.
      - On the subject of 32-bit syscalls: you do not have to assemble your shellcode in 32-bit mode (i.e., you don't need `-m32`). It is perfectly valid to just up and `int 0x80` in the middle of an otherwise-64-bit shellcode.
      - Read [this](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html) thoroughly, especially Section 3.6.1.

  name: Race Conditions
  description: |
    Imagine you're in an adrenaline-pumping race against time, where two or more programs are fiercely competing to access or change shared data.
    This is the thrilling world of race condition exploits! Like daring hackers sliding under closing security gates, these exploits sneak in at just the right millisecond to alter data, causing the system to act in unexpected and often disastrous ways.
    In this digital race, a split-second can spell the difference between security and breach, creating a high-stakes drama that unfolds in the blink of an eye.
    By mastering the mechanics of race conditions, you're not just learning to code, you're stepping into a realm where timing is everything, and the prize is the fortification or exploitation of system vulnerabilities.
    Your code becomes a high-speed racer on the track of system resources, and understanding race conditions is your ticket to the winner's circle!

- id: kernel-security
  name: Kernel Security
  description: |
    The kernel is the core component of an operating system, serving as the bridge between software and hardware. Operating at the lowest level of the OS, the kernel's access is so profound that it can be likened to impersonating the system itself, surpassing even the highest privileges of a root user. Kernel security is paramount because a breach at this level allows attackers to act as if they are the system. Vulnerabilities can lead to scenarios like unauthorized data access, system crashes, or the silent installation of rootkits.

    In order to get started on kernel challenges, you will need to run the challenges inside a virtual machine.  You can start this VM done by running a command while at a terminal, `vm start`.  The virtual machine will automatically load the kernel module located in the `/challenge` directory.  You can then connect your terminal to this virtual machine with `vm connect`!
