  Computer security sandboxing refers to a technique used to isolate potentially malicious code or untrusted programs, ensuring they run in a confined environment where they cannot cause harm to the broader system. By creating a 'sandbox' or restricted space for these programs to operate in, any malicious actions are confined to this isolated area, preventing potential damage to the host system or access to sensitive data.  This module explores sandboxing techniques as well as how hackers can escape a misconfigured sandbox.

  Note, levels 14+ of the sandboxing challenges must be ran inside a virtual machine.  This virtual machine can be launched using the `vm connect` command while at a terminal.

    Some tips and tricks for the challenge problems!

    - Be very careful to understand the timeline of what the challenge does. A file opened BEFORE `chroot()` is very different from a file opened AFTER `chroot()`. The sequence of actions makes a big difference.
    - There aren't any restrictions on shellcode (other than syscalls), so we highly recommend making sure your shellcode exits cleanly. That will make it easier to debug.
    - You can determine the value of constants such as `AT_FDCWD` by writing a quick C program that includes the relevant header files and does `printf("%d\n", AT_FDCWD);`.
    - `chroot()` will fail if you're not running as root. `strace` causes the SUID bit to be ignored, so you must use `sudo strace` to properly trace these challenges. Of course, this will only be possible in practice mode.
    - There is a known issue with strace that, in certain configurations, it will improperly resolve the syscall number of 32-bit syscalls in amd64. Using a newer Linux VM sometimes helps. If you're using `int 0x80` to trigger system calls, the 32-bit ones ARE being used; strace is just lying to you.
    - On the subject of 32-bit syscalls: you do not have to assemble your shellcode in 32-bit mode (i.e., you don't need `-m32`). It is perfectly valid to just up and `int 0x80` in the middle of an otherwise-64-bit shellcode.
    - Read [this](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html) thoroughly, especially Section 3.6.1.
